# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet effective, supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric, instance-based, and lazy learning algorithm, meaning it doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution and defers computation until the prediction phase. Instead of learning a model during training, KNN classifies new instances based on the similarity to existing instances in the training dataset.

## Basic Concept
1. Instance Representation: Each instance in the dataset is represented as a point in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a feature of the instance.
2. Distance Metric: The algorithm calculates the distance between instances using a distance metric, commonly the Euclidean distance. Other distance metrics like Manhattan distance or Minkowski distance can also be used.
3. Voting Mechanism: For classification, the algorithm counts the class labels of the k-nearest neighbors and assigns the majority class to the new instance. For regression, it averages the values of the k-nearest neighbors to predict the target variable.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Choose K: Select the number of neighbors, K, to consider during the classification or regression.
2. Calculate Distance: Compute the distance between the new instance and all instances in the training dataset using a chosen distance metric.
3. Find Neighbors: Identify the K instances with the smallest distances to the new instance.
4. Majority Vote or Average: For classification, assign the class label that is most common among the K neighbors. For regression, predict the average of the target values of the K neighbors.
